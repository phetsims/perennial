Visit each constructor, instance method, and static method and move the parameters from the JSDoc to the function signature.
* Move the JSDoc annotations to the method signature.
* Preserve any documentation in @param annotations, but remove the curly braces around the type (i.e. remove {Type}).
* If none of the @param annotations have any descriptive documentation (only types), then remove the @param annotations entirely.
* Do not add, remove, or change any of the existing documentation text—preserve it exactly as it is.
* If any @param annotation specifies a type of {Object}, change the type declaration to IntentionalAny in the TypeScript signature (this will be fixed later).
* Do not modify any imports—ignore them, as they will be handled later.

The following examples illustrate the transformation:

####################
# Example 1:

Input:
/**
 *	Step the model (automatically called by joist)
 *	@public
 *	@override
 *
 *	@param {number} dt - in seconds
*/
step( dt )

Output:
/**
 *	Step the model (automatically called by joist)
 *
 *	@param dt - in seconds
*/
public step( dt: number ): void

# Example 2:
Input:
/**
 *	The skater moves along the ground with the same coefficient of fraction as the tracks, see #11. Returns a
 *	SkaterState that is applied to this.skater.
 *	@private
 *
 *	@param {number} dt
 *	@param {SkaterState} skaterState
 *
 *	@returns {SkaterState}
*/
stepGround( dt, skaterState )

Output:
/**
 *	The skater moves along the ground with the same coefficient of fraction as the tracks, see #11. Returns a
 *	SkaterState that is applied to this.skater.
*/
private stepGround( dt: number, skaterState: SkaterState ): SkaterState
