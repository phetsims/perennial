/**
 * Wait. Stop. Why do you want to remove the protection rules? Bad things often happen when you want to remove '
 * these. Do you want to delete a release branch? That is probably a bad idea. Maybe just merge main/ into your release '
 * branch. Paper trail about some of the unforeseen troubles can be found here: https://github.com/phetsims/perennial/issues/351
 * Also know that you can set a package flag, "ignoreForAutomatedMaintenanceReleases" to "ditch" a release branch forever.
 *
 * Remove branch protection rules for the provided repo so that main, and release CAN be modified.
 * It is faster to just remove branch protections from the github UI, but this is helpful for automation.
 * For example, you can use this if the automated maintenance release process needs to force push to
 * production branches.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * node perennial/js/scripts/clear-branch-protections-for-repo.js repository-name

 * EXAMPLE:
 * node perennial/js/scripts/clear-branch-protections-for-repo.js john-travoltage
